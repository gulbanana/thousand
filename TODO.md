TO DO
-----

* label/font measure combo
* layout algorithms and refactoring - row, column, etc(?)
* drop shadows
* reevaluate padding algorithm - is it correct to ignore padding when there is no content?
* catch render failures (shouldn't be any known, just exceptions)
* anchors and offsets don't combine correctly
* investigate anchor=corner roundrects (change demo.1000)
* customisable arrowheads
* (medium) IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* (large) object templates
* (large) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
