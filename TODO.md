TO DO
-----

* (major) recursive, non-grid layouts
* per-shape (and diagram) margins; the diagram needs a default, 2 or 5px or something
* generalise shorthand properties (font, etc)
* shape=none (with no padding? correct lines, somehow)
* IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* make sure anonymous objects work
* stdlib - node, point, text, row, etc
* catch render failures
* bidi/0di edges
* editable end caps
* attributes for everything feasible
* improve parser errors - targetted recdec
* (major) edge classes/syntax overhaul
* (major) object templates
* (major) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
* (major) SVG renderer
