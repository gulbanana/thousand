TO DO
-----

* (major) recursive, non-grid layouts
* per-shape (and diagram) margins; the diagram needs a default, 2 or 5px or something
* generalise shorthand properties (font, etc)
* IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* bidi/0di edges
* editable end caps
* attributes for everything feasible
* catch render failures (shouldn't be any known, just exceptions)
* (major) object templates
* (major) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
* (major) SVG renderer
