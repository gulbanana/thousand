TO DO
-----

* per-shape (and diagram) margins; the diagram needs a default, 2 or 5px or something
* generalise shorthand properties (font, etc), as well as optional shorthands like offset
* drop shadows
* IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* bidi/0di edges
* editable end caps
* attributes for everything feasible
* catch render failures (shouldn't be any known, just exceptions)
* anchors and offsets don't combine correctly
* (medium) recursive, non-grid layouts
* (large) object templates
* (large) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
