TO DO
-----

* per-shape (and diagram) margins; the diagram needs a default, 2 or 5px or something
* generalise shorthand properties (font, etc)
* IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* bidi/0di edges
* editable end caps
* attributes for everything feasible
* catch render failures (shouldn't be any known, just exceptions)
* anchors and offsets don't combine correctly
* (medium) recursive, non-grid layouts
* (medium) SVG: externally-measured multiline text (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31469134/how-to-display-multiple-lines-of-text-in-svg)
* (medium) integer centering is causing problems - for example, the line to the diamond in demo.1000 is drawn with integers but the diamond midpoint is a float
* (large) object templates
* (large) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
