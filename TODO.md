TO DO
-----

* drop shadows
* catch render failures (shouldn't be any known, just exceptions)
* anchors and offsets don't combine correctly
* investigate anchor=corner roundrects (change demo.1000)
* customisable arrowheads
* cascade certain properties - text, for example
* (medium) IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* (medium) recursive, non-grid layouts
* (large) object templates
* (large) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
