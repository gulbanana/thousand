TO DO
-----

* 4-way thickness
* align, justify, pack (spacing/sizing)
* layout algorithms/modes - row, column, etc(?)
* canvas mode with X/Y - and/or support direct X Y in any mode
* drop shadows
* reevaluate padding algorithm - is it correct to ignore padding when there is no content?
* catch render failures (shouldn't be any known, just exceptions)
* anchors and offsets don't combine correctly
* investigate anchor=corner roundrects (change demo.1000)
* customisable arrowheads
* (medium) IdentifierOrKeyword, hyphen formatting
* (large) object templates - might require two-phase parsing :(
* (large) image embedding 
* (large) doc generation, at least for attrs. or just handwrite it all?
